So I started collecting links of interesting articles, and then I kept sharing them so thought I'd put them somewhere.

Do feel free to send me links via pull requests and I may give some people rights to the repo if it ever goes anywhere....

So you probably want to start by looking at [interesting links](interesting_links.md) or you can see what [Microsoft are doing](microsoft.md)
